# Accident-Detection-System
  An IoT-based system integrated with Arduino that detects the GPS location of a vehicle prone to accidents using a vibration sensor, with data displayed on the Blynk app.
  A buzzer button is installed into the system which can pressed ensuring that no assistance/ accident happened. The button must be pressed within 10 seconds of the activation of vibration sensor else it would give the location of the vehicle.
